# GitViz: Visualize the evolution of a git repository

Besides being a formidable code version control system, `git` allows you to look back at the evolution of a project at the resolution of individual commits.

With [GitViz](https://github.com/kpj/GitViz) you can visualize this process in your browser and watch how your changes make the project jump around.

You can try it out yourself on https://kpj.github.io/GitViz/.

Here is an example for the project's own repository.

While being a fun project to work on, `GitViz` also combines [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and asynchronous data processing.
