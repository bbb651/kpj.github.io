# Vydia: A modularized video player

Watching long Youtube playlists with long videos can be difficult if you want to stop at arbitrary points and only come back days later.

[Vydia](https://github.com/kpj/Vydia) tries to help be allowing you to watch videos right from the commandline and remembering wherever you stop within a video. Next time you start it up, `Vydia` will automatically know where to resume.

Of course, it can also be used as an ordinary jukebox:

In addition to local playback, `Vydia` is able to stream via AirPlay and DLNA an retrieve videos from various sources.
